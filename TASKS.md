  - Analyze local codebase context for better recommendations
  - Suggest specific files to examine based on issue type

#### 9. Add error handling and caching âœ… ENHANCED IMPLEMENTATION
- **File**: `src/claude-agent.ts` and `src/cli.ts`
- **Status**: Enhanced error handling with comprehensive fallback system
- **Features**: Try/catch blocks, graceful Task tool fallback, web request constraints

  - Complex entity access system issues
  - Issues with extensive comment discussions
  - Status change tracking across multiple contributors

## Future Roadmap Items

### Phase 3: Advanced AI Workflows ðŸš€ FUTURE
#### Multi-Agent Analysis Systems
- **Technical Analysis Agent**: Focus on code quality, API compliance, architecture
- **Contribution Strategy Agent**: Assess developer skill matching and learning opportunities  
- **Timeline Analysis Agent**: Specialized in parsing long-term issue evolution (for 200+ comment threads)
- **Risk Assessment Agent**: Identify breaking changes, backward compatibility concerns

#### Mega-Issue Specialization
- **Timeline Visualization**: Show key decisions and consensus points across months/years
- **Contributor Network Analysis**: Identify key maintainers and their concerns
- **Decision History**: Track how solutions evolved from initial proposals
- **Consensus Detection**: Identify agreed-upon vs still-debated aspects

### Phase 4: Integration Hub ðŸ”— FUTURE  
#### Development Workflow Integration
- **Git Integration**: Detect if issue has associated merge requests/patches, analyze code diffs
- **Drupal.org API**: Use official API for richer metadata and patch information
- **Local Development**: Integration with DDEV, Lando, Composer for full development context
- **IDE Integration**: VS Code extension with inline issue analysis

#### Ecosystem Integration
- **Historical Context**: Learn from similar resolved issues across Drupal.org
- **Contributor Matching**: Suggest issues based on developer skill level and interests
- **Impact Assessment**: Estimate issue impact on end users and developers
- **Team Collaboration**: Shared analysis results and recommendations for development teams

### Phase 5: Advanced Features ðŸŽ¯ FUTURE
#### Intelligence Features
- **Pattern Recognition**: Identify recurring issue types and solution patterns
- **Auto-Prioritization**: Smart triage based on community impact and technical complexity
- **Learning System**: Improve analysis based on contribution outcomes
- **Cross-Project Analysis**: Identify similar issues across different Drupal projects

## Implementation Notes

### Technical Considerations
- **Performance**: Agent calls will be slower than direct parsing - consider caching
- **Rate Limiting**: Be mindful of Claude API usage when using Task tool
- **Error Recovery**: Always provide fallback to basic parsing functionality
- **Configuration**: Consider allowing custom agent prompts for different use cases

### User Experience
- **Progress Indicators**: Show when agent analysis is running (can take 10-30s)
- **Verbose Mode**: Option to show detailed agent reasoning process
- **Batch Processing**: Ability to analyze multiple issues at once
