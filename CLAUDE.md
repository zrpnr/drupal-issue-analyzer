# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Repository Status

This is currently an empty repository with only git initialization. The repository appears to be set up for a project called "ddoto-issues" but contains no source code, configuration files, or documentation yet.

## Development Setup

Since this is a new repository, you will likely need to:

1. Initialize the project structure based on the intended technology stack
2. Set up package management (package.json for Node.js, requirements.txt for Python, etc.)
3. Configure build tools, linters, and testing frameworks as appropriate
4. Create initial project documentation

## Notes for Future Development

- The repository name suggests this may be related to issue tracking or management
- No existing architecture patterns or conventions are established yet
- All development practices and tooling choices are still to be determined

This file should be updated as the project structure and tooling are established.
