## About this project

This project was entirely vibe coded with Claude Code.

I wanted to create a tool that Claude itself could use and that would help members of the Drupal community by making
issues on D.O more approachable.

It was also an experiment to see how far I could get by "tech leading" Claude and providing feedback and direction,
while letting it manage the codebase and improve features without my direct intervention.

## Organizational Support

Claude Code subscription and time spent working on this were sponsored by [Tag1 Consulting](https://tag1consulting.com/)

Special thanks to Jeremy, Fabian, Marco and others who are helping to introduce the team to new ways to think and work.

What a time to be alive!
